# Rover-Travel-Time-and-Battery-Calculations
This Python program calculates the total travel time for different rovers based on their battery power, efficiency, solar capacity, and average velocity. The calculation also includes considerations for charging times and adjusts for storm forecasts, if applicable.

## Features
- Customizable Rover Parameters: Set different parameters for each rover (Charlie, Alpha, November).
- Travel Time Calculation: Computes the total travel time based on distance and average velocity.
- Battery Efficiency: Takes into account how far the rover can travel per battery cycle.
- Charging Time: Calculates how long it will take to charge the roverâ€™s battery fully from 0%.
- Storm Forecast Adjustment: Increases the total travel time by 20% if a storm is forecasted.

## How to Use
- Set the rover number (1, 2, or 3) to match the rover you're using.
- Enter the rover_distance (in kilometers) you want the rover to travel.
- Set the storm_forecast to True or False depending on whether there is a storm forecasted.
- Run the program to calculate the total travel time.
